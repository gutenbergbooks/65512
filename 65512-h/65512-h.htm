<p>Nuclear energy is playing a vital role in the life of every
man, woman, and child in the United States today. In the
years ahead it will affect increasingly all the peoples of the
earth. It is essential that all Americans gain an understanding
of this vital force if they are to discharge thoughtfully their
responsibilities as citizens and if they are to realize fully the
myriad benefits that nuclear energy offers them.</p>
<p>The United States Atomic Energy Commission provides
this booklet to help you achieve such understanding.</p>

They are optically combined (left center) and the combined beam is
then divided by prisms, mirrors and lenses so that part of it shines
on the figurines (foreground) and part on the square holographic

photographic film), it will seem to have only a dull gray surface
until it is viewed with spatially coherent light (such as from a laser
or a beam through a pinhole) shining through it. Then an amazing,

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>The transistor burst upon the electronic scene in the
1950s. Almost overnight the size of new models of radios,
television sets, and a host of other electronic devices
shrank like deflating balloons. Suddenly the hard-of-hearing
could carry their sound amplifiers in their ears. Teenagers
could listen to favorite music wherever they went. Everywhere
we turned the transistor was making its mark. There
was even a proposal before Congress to require that every
home have a transistor radio in case of emergency.</p>
<p>The next development to fire the imagination of scientists
and engineers was the laser&mdash;an instrument that
produces an enormously intense pencil-thin beam of light.
Most of us have heard so much about this invention it
seems hard to believe that the first one was built only a
few years ago. We were told that the laser was going to
have an even greater effect on our lives than the transistor.
It was going to replace everything from dentists&rsquo;
drills to electric wires. The whole world, it seemed,
eventually would be nothing but a gigantic collection of
lasers that would do everything anyone wanted. Roads
would be blazed through jungles at one sweep; our country
would be safe once and for all from intercontinental ballistic
missiles; cancer would be licked; computers would
be small enough to carry in a purse; and so on and on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>Yet for the first couple of years the laser seemed able
to do nothing but blaze holes in razor blades for TV commercials.
Somehow the device never seemed to emerge
from the laboratory, prompting one cynic to call it &ldquo;an
invention in search of an application&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Many of the wild claims came from misunderstandings
on the part of the press, others from exaggerations by
a few manufacturers who wanted free publicity. But with
even less exotic devices than lasers, the road from the laboratory
to the marketplace may often be long and hard.
Price, efficiency, reliability, convenience&mdash;these are all
factors that must be considered. It soon became clear that
with something as new as the laser, much improvement
was necessary before it could be used in science and
medicine, and even more before it could be used in industry.</p>
<p>It now seems, however, that the turning point has been
reached. We have seen laser equipment put on the market
for performing delicate surgery on the eye, spot-welding
tiny electronic circuits (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), and controlling machine
tools with amazing accuracy (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">

needed for accurate placement of beam energy.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>The pace is quickening. At least a dozen manufacturers
have announced that they are designing laser technology
into their products. These are not laboratory experiments
but practical products for measurement and testing, and
for industrial, military, medical, and space uses. The
Army, for example, has announced that it will purchase its
first equipment for use in the field: a portable, highly accurate
range finder for artillery observation.</p>
<p>Still, this hardly accounts for the $100,000,000 spent in
one recent year on laser research and development by
some 500 laboratories in the United States. The U. S.
Government alone has spent about $25,000,000 on laser
research in a single year. Dozens, and perhaps hundreds,
of other applications are on the fire&mdash;simmering or boiling
as the case may be. Some require particular technical
innovations such as greater power or higher efficiency.
Others are entirely new applications. One of the most exciting
of these is holography (pronounced ho LOG ra phy).</p>
<p>Holography involves a completely different approach to
photography. In addition to more immediate applications in
microscopy, information storage and retrieval, and interferometry,
it promises such bonuses as 3-dimensional
color movies and TV someday.</p>
<p>You have to see the holographic process in operation to
believe it. One moment you are looking at what appears to
be an underexposed or lightly smudged photographic plate.
Then suddenly a true-to-life image of the original object
springs into being behind the negative&mdash;apparently suspended
in midair! Not only is the full effect of &ldquo;roundness&rdquo;
and depth there, but you can also see anything lying
behind the object&rsquo;s image by moving your head, exactly
as if the original scene containing the object were really
there.</p>
<p>Still another important field of application is that of
communications. Perhaps because it is less spectacular
than burning holes in razor blades, we haven&rsquo;t heard as
much about it. Yet there are probably more physicists and
engineers working on adapting the laser for use in communications
than on any other single laser project.</p>
<p>The reason for this is the fact that existing communications
facilities are becoming overloaded. Space on transoceanic
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
telephone lines is already at a premium, with
waiting periods sometimes running into hours. Radio
&ldquo;ham&rdquo; operators have been threatened with loss of some
of their best operating frequencies to meet the demand of
emerging nations of Africa for new channels. Television
programs must compete for space on cross-country networks
with telephone, telegraph, and transmission of data.
The increasing use of computers in science, business, and
industry will strain our facilities still further. Communication
satellites will help, but they will not give us the whole
answer; and much development work remains to be done
on satellites.</p>

</div>
<p>Why the interest in the laser for communications? In a
recent experiment all seven of the New York TV channels
were transmitted over a single laser beam. In terms of
telephone conversations, one laser system could theoretically
carry 800,000,000 conversations&mdash;four for each
person in the United States.</p>
<p>In this booklet we shall learn what there is about the
laser that gives it so much promise. We shall investigate
what it is, how it works, and the different kinds of lasers
there are. We begin by discussing some of the more familiar
kinds of radiation, such as radio and microwaves,
light and X rays.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM</span></h2>
<p>Some 85% of what man learns comes to him through his
vision in response to the medium of light. Yet, ironically,
it wasn&rsquo;t until the end of the 17th century that he first began
to get an inkling of what light really is. It took the great
scientific genius Isaac Newton to show that so-called white
light is really a combination of all the colors of the rainbow.
A few years later the Dutch astronomer Christiaan
Huygens introduced the idea that light is a wave motion, a
concept finally validated in 1803 when the British physician
Thomas Young ingeniously demonstrated interference effects
in waves. Thus it was finally realized that the only
difference between the various colors of light was one of
wavelength.</p>
<p>For light was indeed found to be a wave phenomenon, no
different in principle from the water waves you have seen
a thousand times. If you stand at the seashore, you can
easily count the number of waves that approach the shore
in a minute. Divide that number by 60 and you have the
frequency of the wave motion in the familiar unit, cycles-per-second
(cps).<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>You would have to count pretty quickly to do this for
light, however. Light waves vibrate or oscillate at the rate
of some 400 million million times a second. That&rsquo;s the
vibration rate of waves of red light; violet results from
vibrations that are just about twice that fast.</p>
<p>With frequencies of this magnitude, discussion and
handling of data and dimensions are cumbersome and
rather awkward. Fortunately there is another approach.
Let&rsquo;s look again at our ocean waves. We see that there is
a regularity about them (before they begin to break on the
shore). The distance from one crest to the next is significant
and is called the <i>wavelength</i>. Water waves are measured
in feet, and in comparable units light waves are
recorded in ten-millionths of an inch&mdash;again a very cumbersome
number. Scientists therefore use the metric
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
system<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
and have standardized a unit called the angstrom<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>,
which is equal to the one-hundred-millionth part of a
centimeter (10&#8315;&#8312; cm). Thus we find, as shown in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>,
that the visible light range runs from the violet at about
4000 angstroms to red at about 7000 angstroms.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="241" />

<p>At roughly the same time that the wavelength of light
was being determined, the German-British astronomer
William Herschel performed an interesting experiment.
He held a thermometer in turn in the various colors of
light that had been spread out by an optical prism. As he
moved the thermometer from the violet to the red, the
temperature reading rose&mdash;and it continued to rise as he
moved the instrument <i>beyond</i> the red area, where no prismatic
light could be seen.</p>
<p>Thus Herschel discovered infrared rays (the kind of heat
we get from the sun) adjoining the visible red light, and
at the same time found that they were merely a continuation
of the visible spectrum. Shortly thereafter, ultraviolet
rays were found on the other end of the visible light band.</p>
<p>One of the most fascinating movements in science has
been the constant expansion since then of both ends of the
radiating-wave spectrum. The result has come to be called
the <i>electromagnetic spectrum</i>, which, as we see in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>,
encompasses a wide variety of apparently different kinds of
radiation. Above the visible band (the higher frequencies),
we find ultraviolet light, X rays, gamma rays, and some
cosmic rays; below it are infrared radiation, microwaves,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
and radio waves. Only a small proportion of the total
spectrum is occupied by the visible band. Another point of
interest is the inverse relationship between wavelength and
frequency. As one goes up the other goes down.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>

<p>These many kinds of rays and waves vary tremendously
in the ways they interact with matter. But they are all
part of a single family. The only difference among them,
as with the colors of the rainbow, lies in their wavelengths.
In a few cases, as we shall see later, the mode of
generation is also different.</p>
<p>The band of radiation stretching from the infrared to
cosmic rays has been, up to now, largely the concern of
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
physical scientists. Because of their high frequencies, these
radiations are generally handled, when calculations or
measurements must be made, in terms of wavelength.
Radio and microwaves<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>, on the other hand, have been more
in the domain of communications engineers and are more
likely to be discussed in terms of frequency. Thus it is
that your radio is marked off in kilocycles, or thousands
of cycles per second, while light is described as radiation
in the 4000 to 7000 angstrom band.</p>
<p>The relative newness of the various radiations has kept
scientists busy learning about them and, as information
and experience have accumulated, putting them to work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">RADIO WAVES</span></h2>
<p>One of the first of the newly discovered electromagnetic
radiations to be put to work was the radio wave, which is
characterized by long wavelength and low frequency.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> The
low frequency makes it relatively easy to produce a wave
having virtually all its power concentrated at one frequency.</p>
<p>The advantage of this capability becomes obvious after
a moment&rsquo;s thought. Think for example of a group of people
lost in a forest. If they hear sounds of a search party off
in the distance, all likely will begin to shout in various
ways for help. Not a very efficient process, is it? But
suppose all the energy going into the production of this
noise could be concentrated in a single shout or whistle.
Clearly, their chances of being found would be much
improved.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="276" />
<p class="pcap"><b>Figure 5</b> <i>(a) Temporally coherent radiation. (b) Temporally incoherent
radiation.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The single frequency capability of radio waves has been
given the name <i>temporal coherence</i> (or coherence in time)
and is illustrated in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>. Part <i>a</i> shows a single sine
wave, the common way of representing electromagnetic
radiation, and particularly <i>temporally coherent radiation</i>. In
<i>b</i> we see what <i>temporally incoherent radiation</i> (such as the
mixed sounds of the stranded party) would look like.</p>
<p>It was on Christmas Eve 1906 that music and speech came
out of a radio receiver for the first time. Today the sight
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of someone walking, riding, or studying with an earpiece
plugged into a transistor radio is common. But the early
radio enthusiasts <i>had</i> to wear earphones because it takes
considerable power to activate a loudspeaker and the
received signal was quite weak. Some means of increasing,
or amplifying, the signal was needed if the process was to
advance beyond this primitive stage.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The use of vacuum tube or electron tube amplifiers is
so widespread that it is unnecessary to explain their operations
here in any detail. It is important that the principle
of amplification be understood, however. The input or information
wave causes the grid to act as a sort of faucet
as shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>. That is, it controls the flow of electrons
(the current in the circuit) from cathode to anode.
A weak signal can therefore cause a similar, but much
stronger, signal to appear in the circuit. The larger signal
is subsequently used to power a loudspeaker in the radio
set.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="499" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 6</span> <i>Amplification by a three-element vacuum tube.</i></p>

<dt>Cathode</dt>
<dt>Grid</dt>
<dd>Input wave</dd>
<dt>Anode</dt>
<dt>Output wave</dt></dl>
<p>The amplification principle can be applied in another
equally important way. Once a signal gets started in the
circuit, part of it can be <i>fed back into the input</i> of the circuit.
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Thus the signal is made to go &ldquo;round and round&rdquo;, continuously
regenerating itself. The device has become an
<i>oscillator</i>, that is, a frequency generator that produces a
steady and temporally coherent wave. The frequency of the
wave can be rigidly controlled by suitable circuitry.</p>
<p>The oscillator plays a vital part in radio transmission,
for a transmitter beams energy continuously, not just when
sound is being carried. The oscillator generates what is
called a &ldquo;carrier wave&rdquo;. Information, such as speech or
music, is carried in the form of audio (detectable-by-ear)
frequencies, which ride &ldquo;piggyback&rdquo; on the carrier wave.
In other words, the carrier wave is <i>modulated</i>, or varied,
in such a way that it can carry meaningful information. The
familiar expressions AM and FM, for example, stand for
Amplitude Modulation and Frequency Modulation&mdash;two different
ways of impressing information on the carrier wave.
<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a> shows a basic and an amplitude- (or height-)
modulated wave.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p06b.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="499" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 7</span> <i>(a) Unmodulated radio wave.</i> <i>(b) Amplitude-modulated
wave carries information.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The electron tube made its giant contribution to radio,
television, and other electronic devices by making it possible
to generate, detect, and amplify radio waves.</p>
<p>Because radio waves are easily controlled, something
useful can be done with them. Suppose we set up five radio
transmitters, all beaming at the same frequency. The waves
might look like those shown in <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>. Although the waves
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
are temporally (or time) coherent, they are out of step, and
not <i>spatially coherent</i>. But since good control is possible
in radio circuits, we can force each antenna to radiate in
<i>phase</i> (that is, in step) with the others, thus producing fully
coherent radiation (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="643" height="800" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 8</span> <i>(a) Spatially incoherent radiation.</i> <i>(b) Spatially coherent
radiation.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Such a process can increase the radiation <i>power</i> to an
almost unlimited degree. But it does nothing to solve the
problem of the limited total carrying capacity of the radio
spectrum.</p>
<p>The most obvious and best way out of this difficulty is
to raise the operating frequencies into the higher frequency
bands. There are two reasons for this. First, it is clear
that the wider the frequency band (the number of frequencies
available) with which we work, the greater the number of
communication channels that can be created.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>But second, and more important, the higher the frequency
of the wave, the greater is its information-carrying
capacity. In almost the same way that a large truck can
carry a bigger load than a small one, the greater number
of cycles per second in a high frequency wave permits it
to carry more information than a low frequency wave.</p>
<p>However, high frequencies must be generated in different
ways than low frequency waves are; they require
special equipment to handle them. Radio waves are transmitted
by causing masses of free electrons to oscillate or
swing back and forth in the transmitting antenna. (Any time
electrons are made to change their speed or direction
they radiate electromagnetic energy.)</p>
<p>Each kind of oscillator has some limit to the frequencies
at which it can operate. The three-element electron tube
has been successfully developed to oscillate at frequencies
up to, but not including, the vibration rate of the microwave
region. Here ordinary tubes have trouble for the unexpected
reason that free electrons are just too slow in
their reactions to oscillate as rapidly as required in
microwave transmission.</p>
<p>To overcome this obstacle, two new types of electron
tubes were developed: the klystron in 1938 and the traveling-wave
tube some 10 years later. These lifted operation well
up into the microwave region; it was the klystron that
made wartime radar possible. Today many communication
links depend heavily upon microwave frequencies.</p>
<p>At this point in our story we have a situation where low
temporally coherent radio waves and microwaves can be
generated, but nothing of higher frequency. Communications
engineers have gazed wistfully, but almost hopelessly,
at light waves, whose frequencies are millions of times
higher than radio waves. Thus, just by way of example,
some 15 million separate TV channels could operate in the
frequency range between red and orange in the visible band.</p>
<p>What, then, is the problem?</p>
<p>Why is light so much more difficult to handle?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">LIGHT AND THE ATOM</span></h2>
<p>Since light waves have such high frequencies, a different
mode of generation comes into play. We can no
longer count on the controlled movement of free electrons
<i>outside</i> atoms and molecules. Rather, light and all
the radiations in the higher frequencies are generated by
the movement of electrons <i>inside</i> atoms and molecules.</p>
<p>Let us review momentarily the modern, albeit highly
simplified, conception of an atom. Remember that no one
has yet seen one. We describe the atom on the basis of
how it acts, as well as how it reacts to things scientists
do to it.</p>
<p>For the present purpose, the best model we have of the
atom is that of a miniature solar system, with a nucleus
or heavy part at the center and a cloud of electrons dashing
around the nucleus in fixed orbits.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;fixed orbits&rdquo; is used advisedly.</p>
<p>Our planet moves in a certain orbit around the sun. If
we attached a large enough rocket to the earth we theoretically
<i>could</i> move it closer to or farther away from the
sun. In the atom, we have learned, this cannot be done. An
electron can only exist in one of a certain number of fixed
orbits; different kinds of atoms have different numbers
of orbits.</p>
<p>We might think in terms of an elevator that can only
stop at the various floors of an apartment building. Each
upper floor is like an orbit of the electron. But you get
nothing for nothing in the world of physics, and just as it
takes energy to raise an elevator to a higher floor, it takes
energy to move an electron to an outer orbit.</p>
<p>Hence the atom is said to be raised to higher <i>energy</i> levels
when an electron is nudged to an outer orbit. The energy
input can be of many different kinds. Examples are heat,
pressure, electrical current, chemical energy, and various
forms of electromagnetic radiation. If too much energy is
put into the elevator it goes flying out the roof. If too much
energy is put into the atom, one or more of its electrons
will go flying out of the atom. This is called <i>ionization</i>, and
the atom, now minus one of its negative electrons and therefore
positively charged, is called a positive <i>ion</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>But if the <i>right</i> amount of energy is put into the atom,
one of its electrons will merely be raised to a higher
energy level. Shown in <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>, for instance, are the
ground state (Circle No. 1) and two possible higher energy
levels. As you can see there are three possible transitions.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="610" />
<p class="pcap"><b>Figure 9</b> <i>Schematic representation of the electron orbits and energy
levels of an atom. Each circle represents a separate possible
orbit and each arrow a possible energy level difference.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The higher energy levels are abnormal, or excited,
states, however, and the electron will shortly fall back to
its normal (ground state) orbit (assuming some other
electron has not fallen into it first). In order for the electron
to do this (go back to its normal orbit), it must give
off the energy it has acquired. This it does in the form of
electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>The energy difference between the two levels will determine
what kind of radiation is emitted, for there is a
direct correlation between energy and frequency.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> If the
energy difference between the two levels is such that the
frequency of emitted radiation is roughly between 10&sup1;&#8308; and
10&sup1;&#8309; cycles per second, we see the radiation as light. When
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
more energy is added, the radiation emerges as ultraviolet
or X rays. In other words the higher the energy difference,
the higher the frequency, and vice versa. Thus it is that
cosmic rays, with the highest frequencies known to man,
can pass right through us as if we weren&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>This simple picture of energy levels and associated
frequencies doesn&rsquo;t quite hold for ordinary white light,
however. Such light is generally produced by a process
called incandescence, which results from the heating of a
material until it glows. True, the atoms of the incandescent
material are being raised to higher energy levels by
chemical energy (as in fire), electricity (light bulb), or
nuclear energy (the sun). In a hot solid, however, the explanation
becomes more complicated. Many different electronic
configurations are possible and the differences in
energy among the various levels (which can be many more
than the three shown in <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>) vary only slightly from
one another. The result is a wide band of radiation.</p>
<p>Thus, while the incandescent electric bulb is a great
advance over fire, it is still a very inefficient source of
light. Because it depends upon incandescence, a considerable
portion of the electrical input goes into the production
of unwanted heat, for the bulb&rsquo;s filament radiates in the
infrared as well as the visible region.</p>
<p>For providing illumination, the fluorescent tube is far
more efficient than the incandescent lamp: a 40-watt fluorescent
tube gives as much light as a 150-watt incandescent
light. This is because its radiation is more controlled,
operating more in accord with our description of electronic
energy levels. Hence more of its output is in the
desired visual region of the spectrum.</p>
<p>In certain types of lighting, particular energy level
changes may predominate, leading to the characteristic
colors of neon tubes and vapor lamps. Although the resulting
radiation bandwidth is narrow enough in these
devices to appear as a definite color instead of the broad
spectrum we know as white, it is still quite broad. In other
words, the radiation is still frequency incoherent&mdash;and it
is still spatially incoherent.</p>
<p>To understand this, let us return for a moment to the
group of radio antennas we showed in <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>. All of
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
them, you will recall, could be made to radiate in phase.
In the production of light, however, each antenna is replaced
by a single atom!</p>
<p>This creates two problems. First, because the energy
stored in the atom is quite small, it comes out not as a
continuous wave but as a tiny packet of radiation&mdash;a <i>photon</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>
It has an effect more like the hack of an ax than the
buzz of a power saw.</p>
<p>Second, atoms are notoriously &ldquo;individualistic&rdquo;. When a
batch of atoms in a material has been raised to higher
energy levels there is no way to know in what order, or in
what direction, they will release their energy.</p>
<p>This kind of process is called <i>spontaneous emission</i>,
since each atom &ldquo;makes up its own mind&rdquo;. All we know is
that within a certain period of time&mdash;a short period, to be
sure&mdash;a certain percentage of these higher energy atoms
will release their photons.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="439" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 10</span> <i>Ordinary light
is a jumble of frequencies,
directions, and phases.</i></p>
</div>
<p>What we have, then, is incoherent
radiation&mdash;a jumble
of frequencies (or colors), directions,
and phases. Such
light, symbolized in <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>,
works well enough in lighting
up this page, but is almost
worthless as a carrier of information
(and in other ways,
as we shall see shortly). About
the best that can be done with
it is to turn it on and off in a
sort of visual Morse code,
which is exactly what is done
on the blinker communication systems sometimes used for
ship-to-ship communication.</p>
<p>In other words, ordinary light cannot be modulated as
radio waves can.</p>
<p>It is of interest to note, however, that ordinary white
light <i>can</i> be made coherent, to some extent, but at a very
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
high cost in the intensity of the light. For example, we
might first pass the light through a series of filters, each
of which would subtract some portion of the spectrum,
until only the desired wavelength came through. As can be
seen in <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>, only a small fraction of the original
light would be left.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="237" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 11</span> <i>Obtaining coherent radiation the hard way. Filters and

<p>We would then have monochromatic (one color) light,
which is temporally coherent radiation, but it would still
be spatially incoherent. In our diagram, we show three
monochromatic waves. If we then passed this light through
a tiny pinhole as shown, most of these few remaining waves
would be blocked; the ones that got through would be pretty
much in step. (In a similar manner, a true point source of
light would produce spatially coherent radiation; but, as in
the process described here, there wouldn&rsquo;t be very much of
it.)</p>
<p>We have, finally, obtained coherent light.</p>
<p>The important thing about the laser is that, by its very
nature, it produces coherent light automatically.</p>
<p>Now....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">WHAT&rsquo;S SO SPECIAL ABOUT COHERENT LIGHT?</span></h2>
<p>So desirable are the qualities of coherent light that the
complicated filtering process described above has actually
been used. For example, one British experimenter, Dennis
Gabor, used it in the 1940s in an attempt to make a better
microscope. But so great was the effort, and so meager
the resulting light, that this project was abandoned.</p>
<p>In the course of Dr. Gabor&rsquo;s experiments, however, he
did manage to make a special kind of picture, using coherent
light, which he called a <i>hologram</i>. He derived the
name from two Greek words meaning a <i>whole picture</i>. We
shall see why in a moment.</p>
<p>Ordinary black and white photographs merely record
darks and lights, or the intensity of the illumination,
thereby providing a scale of grays, nothing more. But
because waves of coherent light consistently maintain their
relative spacing, they can be used to record additional information,
namely the distance from objects.</p>
<p>For example, if we shine a beam of coherent (laser)
light between two objects we can, knowing the light wavelength,
determine the distance between them to a high
degree of accuracy. The basic idea is diagramed in <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a>.
It can be seen that the number of waves times the
wavelength gives the precise distance (to within 1 wavelength
of light) from the laser source to each object. But
this would be a difficult process to implement.</p>
<p>A better way, and one that is already in operation, is
to use conventional methods to measure the approximate
distance and use the laser beam for precise or fine measurement.
In the device shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, the beam is
split into two parts. One part is kept in the instrument
itself to act as a reference. The other is aimed at a reflector,
which sends it back to a detector in the main
device, where it is automatically compared with the reference
beam. If the two beams are in phase (that is, if
their crests are superimposed), the waves combine and
produce a high intensity beam at the detector. As the reflector
moves closer to or farther away from the laser
source the beam intensity decreases and then increases
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
again as the wave crests move in and out of phase. The
instrument counts the changes and displays the distance
the reflector moves, as a function of the wavelengths, on
the control cabinet meters.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p>Since the word for the interaction of the waves in a
system like this is &ldquo;interference&rdquo;, the measurement process
is called <i>interferometry</i> (pronounced in ter fer OM e
try). Although not new, it can now be applied for the first
time in machine tool applications, providing the accuracy
needed in this age of space technology and microminiaturization.
Measurements with a laser interferometer can be
made with an accuracy of 0.5 part per million at distances
up to 200 inches. Such precision was previously unheard
of in a machine shop environment, having been limited
to laboratory measurements, and only at a range of a few
inches. Under similar laboratory conditions, measurements
by laser interferometry now detect movements of 10&#8315;&sup1;&sup1;
centimeter, a distance approaching the dimensions of an
atomic nucleus.</p>
<p>Now let us suppose we expand the laser beam as shown on
<a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>, and, with the aid of a mirror, direct part of it (the
reference beam) at a photographic plate. The remaining
portion of the diverging beam is used to illuminate the
object to be photographed. Some of this light (the object
beam) is reflected toward the plate and carries with it
information about the object, as indicated by the wavy line.
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
In the region where these two beams intersect, interference
occurs, and a sample of this interference is recorded within
the photographic emulsion. Where two crests meet a
dark spot is recorded; where the waves are out of phase
the processed plate is clear. The result is a hologram, a
complex pattern of &ldquo;fringes&rdquo;, characteristic of the contour
and light and dark areas of the object, as well as its distance
from the plate. These fringes have the ability to
diffract light rays. When light from a laser, or a point
source of white light, is directed at the hologram from the
same direction as the reference beam, part of the light is
&ldquo;bent&rdquo; so that it appears to come from the place once occupied
by the object. The result is a remarkably realistic
3-dimensional image.</p>
<p>There, in a nutshell, is the incredible new technique of
holography. The extreme order of laser light is illustrated
by the regularity of the dots on the cover of this booklet.</p>
<p>This strange kind of light provides us with yet other
advantages. Indeed, one of the most important is the fact
that the energy of the laser is not being sprayed out in all
directions. All of it is concentrated in the narrow beam
that emerges from the device. And it <i>stays</i> narrow. Laser
light has already been shone on the moon, the beam
spreading out to only a few miles in traveling there from
earth. The best optical searchlight beam would spread
wider than the moon itself, thus dissipating its energy.</p>
<p>It is for this reason, as well as its temporal coherence,
that laser light is being considered for communications.
A narrow beam is particularly important for space communications
because of the long distances involved.</p>
<p>But it is also possible to focus laser light as no light
has ever been focused before. At close range a laser beam
can be focused down to a circle just a few wavelengths
across, concentrating its energy and making it possible
to drill holes only 0.0002 inch in diameter. The photo on
<a href="#Page_52">page 52</a> shows the exquisite control that can be exercised.</p>
<p>Let us see what this focusability means in terms of
power. Consider, by way of analogy, a dainty 100-pound
lady in a pair of spike-heeled shoes. As she takes a step,
her weight will be concentrated on one of those heels. If
the area of the heel is, say, one quarter of a square inch
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
(&frac12; &times; &frac12; inch), the pressure exerted on the poor tile or
carpet rises to 400 pounds per square inch (4 &times; 100) and if
the heel is only &frac14; inch on a side, the pressure will be
1600 pounds per square inch!</p>

<p>What we are getting at, of course, is the fact that the
coherence of the laser beam permits it to be concentrated
into a tiny area. Thus whatever total energy is being sent
out by the laser can be concentrated to the point where its
effective energy is tremendous. The sun emits some
6500 watts per square centimeter. Laser beams have
already reached 500 <i>million</i> watts per square centimeter.</p>
<p>But the power of the laser does not derive solely from
its ability to be focused. Even an unfocused beam is several
times more powerful than the sun&rsquo;s output (per square
centimeter).</p>

<p>The crucial difference between the sun&rsquo;s light or any
ordinary kind of light and laser light lies in the extent to
which the emission of energy can be controlled. In the
production of ordinary light the atoms, as we know, emit
spontaneously, or in an uncontrolled fashion. But if the
atoms could be forced to take in the proper amount of
energy, store it, and release it when we wanted them to,
we would have <i>stimulated</i>, rather than spontaneous, emission.</p>
<p>This, however, is practically the same as the amplification
principle we discussed earlier. In that case, a small
radio signal is jacked up into a large one by stimulating
an available power source to release its energy at the
same wavelength and in step with the smaller signal.</p>
<p>The question is, how can we do this with light?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CONTROLLED EMISSION</span></h2>
<p>The laser and its parent, the maser, can be traced back
half a century to its theoretical beginnings. The great
physicist Albert Einstein is most widely known for his
work in relativity. But he did early and important work
on that other gigantic 20th century scientific achievement,
the quantum theory.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> In one of his papers, published first
in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1916, Einstein showed that controlled
emission of light energy could be obtained from an
atom under certain conditions. When an atom or molecule
has somehow had its energy level raised, the release of
this stored energy could be stimulated by subjecting the
atom or molecule to a small &ldquo;shot&rdquo; of electromagnetic
radiation of the proper frequency.</p>
<p>Einstein wrote that when such a photon of energy caused
an electron to drop from a higher to a lower orbit, the
electron would emit another photon of the same frequency
and in the same direction as the one that hit it.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> In other
words, the energy of the emitted photon would be added
to that of the photon that stimulated the emission in the
first place. Here, <i>potentially</i>, was light amplification. The
three major factors, absorption of energy, spontaneous
emission, and stimulated emission are diagrammed in
<a href="#fig14">Figure 14</a>.</p>
<p>There the matter lay for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>In 1951 Charles H. Townes, then on the Columbia University
faculty, was interested in ways of extending to still
higher frequencies the range of microwaves available for
use in communications and in other scientific applications.
Townes and other scientists who were interested in the
problem were to meet in Washington, D. C., on the 26th of
April. The night before the meeting he slept in a small
Washington hotel; but he awoke at 5:30&mdash;pondering, pondering
the high frequency problem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>He dressed and took a walk, then sat on a park bench
and savored the beauty of azaleas in bloom. But all the
while his mind was running over the various aspects of
the problem.</p>

<p>Suddenly the answer came to him.</p>
<p>Normally more of the molecules in any substance are
in low-energy states than in high ones. He would change
the natural balance and create a situation with an abnormally
large number of high-energy molecules. Then he
would stimulate them to emit their energy by nudging them
with microwaves. Here was amplification.</p>
<p>He could even take some of the emitted radiation and
feed it back into the device to stimulate additional molecules,
thereby creating an oscillator. This <i>feedback</i> arrangement,
he knew, could be carried out in a cavity,
which would resonate (just like an organ pipe) at the proper
frequency. The resonator would be a box whose dimensions
were comparable with the wavelength of the radiation,
that is, a few centimeters on a side.</p>
<p>On the back of an envelope he figured out some of the
basic requirements. Three years, and many experiments,
later the maser (<i>m</i>icrowave <i>a</i>mplification by <i>s</i>timulated
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
<i>e</i>mission of <i>r</i>adiation) was a reality. The original maser
was a small metal box into which excited ammonia molecules
were added. When microwaves were beamed into the
excited ammonia the box emitted a pure, strong beam of
high frequency microwaves, far more temporally coherent
than any that had ever been achieved before. The output of
an ammonia maser is stable to one part in 100 billion,
making it an extremely accurate atomic &ldquo;clock&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> Moreover,
the amplifying properties of masers have been found
to be very useful for magnifying faint radio signals from
space, and for satellite communications.</p>
<p>Ammonia gas was chosen for the first maser because
molecules of ammonia have two individual energy states
that are separated by a gap corresponding in frequency to
23,870 megacycles (23,870 million cycles) per second.
Ammonia molecules also react to a nonuniform electric
field in ways that depend on their energy level: low-level
molecules can be attracted and high-level ones repelled by
the same field. Thus it is possible to separate the low-energy
molecules from the high, and to get the excited
molecules into the cavity without too much trouble.</p>
<p>This procedure for getting the majority of atoms or
molecules in a container into a higher energy state, is
called <i>population inversion</i> and is basic to the operation of
both masers and lasers.</p>
<p>It should be noted that two Russians, N. G. Basov and
A. M. Prokhorov, were working along similar lines independently
of Townes. In 1952 they presented a paper at an
All-Union (U.S.S.R.) Conference, in which they discussed
the possibility of constructing a &ldquo;molecular generator&rdquo;,
that is, a maser. Their proposal, first published in 1954,
was in many respects similar to Townes&rsquo;s. In 1955, Basov
and Prokhorov discussed, in a short note, a new way to
obtain the active atomic systems for a maser, a method
that turned out to be of great importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Thus on October 29, 1964, the Nobel Prize in Physics
was awarded, not only to Townes, but to Basov and Prokhorov
as well. The award was for fundamental work in
the field of quantum electronics, which has led to the
construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the
&ldquo;aser&rdquo; principle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">A LASER IS BORN</span></h2>
<p>Following the maser development, there was much
speculation about the possibility of extending the principle
to the optical region. Indeed the first lasers&mdash;<i>l</i>ight
<i>a</i>mplification by <i>s</i>timulated <i>e</i>mission of <i>r</i>adiation&mdash;were
called &ldquo;optical masers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The difficulty, of course, was that optical wavelengths
are so tiny&mdash;about &sup1;/&#8321;&#8320;,&#8320;&#8320;&#8320; that of microwaves. The
maser principle depended upon a physical resonator, a
box a few centimeters (or even millimeters) in length. But
at millimeter wavelengths, such resonators are already
so small that they are hard to make accurately. Making a
box &sup1;/&#8321;,&#8320;&#8320;&#8320; that size was out of the question. Another
approach was necessary.</p>
<p>In 1958 A. L. Schawlow of Bell Telephone Laboratories
and Dr. Townes outlined the theory and proposed a structure
for an optical maser. They suggested that resonance
could be obtained by making the waves travel back and
forth along a relatively long, thin column of amplifying
substance that had parallel reflectors at the ends.</p>
<p>After their theory of the optical maser had been published,
the race to build the first actual device began in
earnest. The winner, in 1960, was Dr. T. H. Maiman, then
with Hughes Aircraft Company. (He is now president of
Maiman Associates.) The active substance he used was a
single crystal of ruby, with the ends ground flat and
silvered.</p>
<p>Ruby is an aluminum oxide in which a small fraction of
the aluminum atoms in the molecular structure, or lattice,
have been replaced with chromium atoms. These atoms
absorb green and blue light and hence impart a red color
to the ruby. The chromium atoms can be boosted from
their ground state into excited states when they absorb the
green or blue light. This process, by which population
inversion is achieved, has been given the name pumping.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Pumping in a crystal laser is generally achieved by
placing the ruby rod within a spiral flash lamp (<a href="#fig15">Figure 15</a>)
that operates like those used in high-speed (stroboscopic)
photography. When the lamp is flashed, a bright beam of
red light emerges from the ruby, shining out through one
end, which has been only partially silvered.</p>

<p>The duration of this flash of red light is quite brief,
lasting only some 300 millionths of a second, but it is very
intense. In the early lasers, such a flash reached a peak
power of some 10,000 watts.</p>
<p>When Maiman&rsquo;s device was successfully built and operating,
a public relations expert was called in to help
introduce this revolutionary device to the world. He took
one look at the laser and decided that it was too small and
insignificant looking and would not photograph well. Looking
around the lab, he spotted a larger laser and decided
that that one was better.</p>
<p>Dr. Maiman informed him in his best scientific manner
that laser action had not been achieved with that one. But
the world of promotion won out, and Dr. Maiman allowed
the larger device to be photographed on the assumption&mdash;or
was it hope?&mdash;that he would be able to get it to operate
in the future. (He did.)</p>
<p>The device shown in <a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a> is the true first laser.
The all-important crystal rod is seen at the center. These
crystals, incidentally, must be quite free of extraneous
material; hence they are artificially &ldquo;grown&rdquo;, as shown in
<a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a>. The single large crystal is formed as it is
pulled slowly from the &ldquo;melt&rdquo;, after which it is ground to
size and polished.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">LASING&mdash;A NEW WORD</span></h2>
<p>Now we can begin to put together the various processes
and equipment we have been discussing separately. Perhaps
the best way to do this is to look again at the word
<i>laser</i> and recall its meaning: <i>l</i>ight <i>a</i>mplification by <i>s</i>timulated
<i>e</i>mission of <i>r</i>adiation. Our objective is to create a
powerful, narrow, coherent beam of light. Let us see how
to do this.</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a> we imagine a laser crystal containing many
atoms in the ground state (white dots) and a few in the
excited state (black dots). Pumping light (wavy arrows in <i>a</i>)
raises most of the atoms to the excited state, creating the
required population inversion.</p>

Pumping light raises many atoms to excited state. (b) Lasing begins
when a photon is spontaneously emitted along the axis of the

resulting wave is reflected back and forth many times between the
ends of the crystal and builds in intensity until finally it flashes out
of the partially silvered end.</i></p>

<p><i>Lasing</i> begins when an excited atom spontaneously emits
a photon parallel to the axis of the crystal (<i>b</i>). (Photons
emitted in other directions merely pass out of the crystal.)
The photon stimulates another atom in its path to contribute
a second photon, in step, and in the same direction.</p>
<p>This process continues as the photons are reflected back
and forth between the ends of the crystal. (We might think
of lone soldiers falling into step with a column of marching
men.) The beam builds up until, when amplification is great
enough (<i>c</i>), it flashes out through the partially silvered
mirror at the right&mdash;a narrow, parallel, concentrated,
coherent beam of light, ready for....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">SOME INTERESTING APPLICATIONS</span></h2>
<p>Application of lasers can be divided into two broad
categories: (1) commercial, industrial, military, and medical
uses, and (2) scientific research. In the first case,
lasers are used to do something that has been done in
another way up to now (but not as well). Sometimes a
laser solves a particular problem. For example, one of the
first applications was in eye surgery, for &ldquo;welding&rdquo; a
detached retina. The laser is particularly useful here because
laser light can penetrate transparent objects such
as the eye&rsquo;s lens (<a href="#fig19">Figure 19</a>), eliminating the need to
make a cut into the eye.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">

<dt>Retina</dt></dl>
<p>Surgeons have long wanted a better technique for treating
extremely small areas of tissue. A laser beam, focused
into a small spot, performs perfectly as a lilliputian surgical
knife. An additional advantage is that the beam, being
of such high intensity, can also sterilize or cauterize tissue
as it cuts.</p>
<p>The narrowness of the laser beam has made it ideal for
applications requiring accurate alignment. Perhaps the
ultimate here is the 2-mile-long linear accelerator built
by Stanford University for the United States Atomic Energy
Commission. &ldquo;Arrow-straight&rdquo; would not have been nearly
good enough to assure expected performance. A laser beam
was the only technique that could accomplish the incredible
task of keeping the &#8542; inch bore of the accelerator straight
along its 2-mile length. A remote monitoring system,
based on the same laser beam, tells operators when a
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
section of the accelerator has shifted out of line (due for
example to small earth movements) by more than about
&sup1;/&#8323;&#8322; inch&mdash;and identifies the section.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
<p><a href="#fig20">Figure 20</a> shows the 2-mile-long &ldquo;klystron gallery&rdquo; that
generates the power for kicking the high-energy particles
down the tube. The gallery parallels the accelerator housing
and lies 25 feet beneath it (<a href="#fig21">Figure 21</a>). The large tube
houses the optical alignment system and supports the
smaller accelerator tube above. Target patterns dropped
into the large tube at selected points produce an interference
pattern at the far end of the tube similar to the one
in <a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a>. Precise alignment of the tube is achieved by
aiming the laser at the center dot of the pattern. Then the
section that is out of line is physically moved until the dot
appears in the proper place at the other end of the tube. It
is the extreme coherence of the laser beam that makes
this technique possible.</p>
<p>Having heard that laser light has bored through steel
and is being used in microwelding, some have asked
whether the laser will ever be used to weld bridge members
and other structural girders. This is missing the whole
point of the laser: It would be like washing your floor with
a toothbrush (even one with extra stiff bristles)! There
would be no advantage to using lasers for large-scale
welding; present equipment for this operation is quite
satisfactory and far less wasteful of input power. The
sensible approach is to use lasers where existing processes
leave something to be desired.</p>
<p>Until the advent of the laser, for example, there was no
good way to weld wires 0.001 inch in diameter. Nor was
there a good way to bore the tiny hole in a diamond that is
used as a die for drawing such fine wire. It used to take 2
days to drill a single diamond. With laser light the operation
takes 2 minutes&mdash;and there is no problem with rapid
wear of a cutting tool.</p>
<p>So much for the first category of application. In the
second category, namely use of the laser as a scientific
tool, we enter a more theoretical domain. Here we use
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
coherent light as an extension of ourselves, to probe into
and to look at the world around us.</p>

</div>
<p>Much experimental science is a matter of cooling, heating,
grinding, squeezing, or otherwise abusing matter to
see how it will react. With each new tool&mdash;ultrafast centrifuges,
high- and low-pressure and extreme-temperature
chambers, intense magnetic fields, atomic accelerators and
so on&mdash;more has been learned about this still-puzzling
world.</p>
<p>Since coherent light is something new, we can do things
to matter that have not been done before, and see how it
reacts. The laser is being used to investigate many problem
areas in biology, chemistry, and physics. For example,
sound waves of extremely high frequency can be
generated in matter by subjecting it to laser light. These
intense vibrations may have profound effects on materials.</p>

<p>In the chemical field the sharp beam and monochromatic
energy of the laser hold great promise in the exploration
of molecular structure and the nature of chemical reactions.
Chemical reactions usually are set off by heat,
agitation, electricity, or other broadly applied means.
None of these energizers allow the fine control that the
laser beam does. Its extremely fine beam can be focused
to a tiny spot, thus allowing chemical activity to be pinpointed.
But there is a second advantage: The monochromaticity
of coherent light also makes it possible to
control the energy (in addition to the intensity) of the beam
accurately by simply varying the wavelength. Thus it may
be possible, for instance, to cause a reaction in one group
of molecules and not in another.</p>
<p>One application in chemistry that holds great promise
is the use of laser energy for causing specific chemical
reactions such as those involved in the making of plastics.
Bell Telephone Laboratory scientists have changed the
styrene monomer (a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; plastic material) to its final
state, polystyrene, in this way. The success of these and
similar experiments elsewhere opens for exploration a
vast area of molecular phenomena.</p>
<p>In another scientific application, the laser is being used
more and more as a teaching tool. Coherence is a concept
that formerly had to be demonstrated by diagrams, formulas,
and inference from experiments. The laser makes
it possible to see coherence &ldquo;in action&rdquo;, along with many
of the physical effects that result from it. Such phenomena
as diffraction, interference, the so-called Airy disc patterns,
and spatial harmonics, always difficult to demonstrate
to students in the abstract, can now be seen quite
concretely.</p>
<p>Other interesting things can also be seen more plainly
now. At the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, laser light
is being used to &ldquo;look&rdquo; at plasmas; the result of one such
look is shown in <a href="#fig23">Figure 23</a>. Plasmas are ionized gaseous
mixtures. Their study lies at the heart of a constant search
by atomic scientists for a self-sustained, controlled fusion
reaction that can be used to provide useful thermonuclear
power. This kind of reaction provides the almost unlimited
energy in the sun and other stars. It is more efficient and
releases less radioactivity than the other principal nuclear
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
process, fission, which is used in atomic-electric
power plants.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>

</div>
<p>Westinghouse Electric Corporation scientists, on the
other hand, have used the concentrated energy of the laser,
not to look at, but to <i>produce</i> a plasma (<a href="#fig24">Figure 24</a>). They
blasted an aluminum target the size of a pinhead with a
laser beam, thereby vaporizing it and creating a plasma.
The calculated temperature in the electrically charged
gas was 3,000,000&deg; centigrade. This is pretty hot, but still
not hot enough for a thermonuclear reaction.</p>

<p>The temperature of a plasma necessary to sustain a
thermonuclear reaction is so high (above 10,000,000&deg;C)
that any material is vaporized instantly on coming into
contact with it. The only means developed so far to contain
the plasma is an intense magnetic field, or &ldquo;magnetic
bottle&rdquo;; containment has been accomplished for only a few
thousandths of a second at most. The objective of the
Westinghouse research, which was supported by the Atomic
Energy Commission, was to study in detail the interaction
of the plasma with a magnetic field.</p>
<p>We do not have room to describe more applications in
detail, but it may be interesting to list a few other uses of
lasers&mdash;some commercial and some still experimental:</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">A MULTITUDE OF LASERS</span></h2>
<p>It is almost self-evident that no single device, even one as
incredible as the laser, could accomplish all the feats mentioned
in the preceding paragraphs. After all, some of these
applications require high power but not extremely high monochromaticity,
while in others the reverse may be true. Yet,
by its very nature, any laser produces a beam with one, or
at the most a few, wavelengths, and many different materials
would be needed to provide the many different
wavelengths required for all the tasks listed.</p>
<p>Also, the first laser was a pulsed device. Light energy
was pumped in and a bullet of energy emerged from it.
Then the whole process had to be repeated. Pulsed operation
is fine for spot-welding and for applications such as
radar-type rangefinding, where pulses of energy are normally
used anyway. With lasers smaller objects can be
detected than when using the usual microwaves. But a
pulsed process is not useful for communications. In other
words, pulsing is good for certain applications but not for
others.</p>
<p>And of course solid crystals are difficult to manufacture.
Hence, it was natural for laser pioneers to look hopefully
at gases. Gas lasers would be easier to make&mdash;simply fill
a glass tube with the proper gas and seal it.</p>
<p>But other advantages would accrue. For one thing the
relatively sparse population of emitting atoms in a gas
provides an almost ideally homogeneous medium. That is,
the emitting atoms (corresponding to chromium in the ruby
crystal) are not &ldquo;contaminated&rdquo; by the lattice or host atoms.
Since only active atoms need be used, the frequency coherence
of a gas laser would probably be even better than
that of the crystal laser, they reasoned.</p>
<p>It was less than a year after the development of the ruby
laser that Ali Javan of Bell Telephone Laboratories proposed
a gas laser employing a mixture of helium and neon
gases. This was an ingeniously contrived partnership
whereby one gas did the energizing and the other did the
amplifying. Gas lasers now utilize many different gases
for different wavelength outputs and powers and provide
the &ldquo;purest&rdquo; light of all. An additional advantage is that
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
the optical pumping light could be dispensed with. An input
of radio waves of the proper frequency did the job very
nicely.</p>
<p>But most significant of all, Javan&rsquo;s gas laser provided
the first continuous output. This is commonly referred to
as CW (continuous wave) operation. The distinction between
pulsed and CW operation is like the difference between
baking one loaf of bread at a time and putting the
ingredients in one end of a baking machine and having a
continuous loaf emerge at the other.</p>
<p>When a non-expert thinks of a laser, he is apt to think of
power&mdash;blinding flashes of energy&mdash;as illustrated in <a href="#fig26">Figure 26</a>.
As we know, this is only a small part of the capability
of the laser. Nevertheless, since lasers are often
specified in terms of power output it may be well to discuss
this aspect.</p>
<p>The two units generally used are <i>joules</i> and <i>watts</i>. You
are familiar with a watt and have an idea of its magnitude:
think, for example, of a 15-watt or a 150-watt bulb. A watt
is a unit of <i>power</i>; it is the rate at which (electrical) work
is being done.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="564" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 26</span> <i>High power is demonstrated as a laser beam blasts
through metal chain.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The joule is a unit of <i>energy</i> and can be thought of as the
total capacity to do work. One joule is equivalent to 1 watt-second,
or 1 watt applied for 1 second. But it can also
mean a 10-watt burst of laser light lasting 0.1 second, or
a billion watts lasting a billionth of a second.</p>
<p>In general, the crystal (ruby) lasers are the most powerful,
although other recently introduced materials, such
as liquids (see <a href="#fig27">Figure 27</a>) and specially prepared glass,
are providing competition. With proper auxiliary equipment,
bursts of several <i>billion</i> watts have been achieved;
but the burst lasts only about 100 millionths of a second.
For certain uses, that&rsquo;s just what is wanted: a highly concentrated
burst of energy that does its work without giving
the material being &ldquo;shot&rdquo; a chance to heat up and spread
the energy, perhaps damaging adjacent areas.</p>

tube.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Since the joule gives a measure of the total energy in
a laser burst it is not applicable to CW output. Power in
this area began low&mdash;in the milliwatt (one thousandth of a
watt) region&mdash;but has been creeping up steadily. A recent
gas laser utilizing carbon dioxide has already reached
550 watts of continuous infrared radiation. This is the
giant 44-footer shown in <a href="#fig28">Figure 28</a>. An advantage of gas
(and liquid) lasers is that they can be made just about as
large as one wishes. By way of comparison, the smallest
gas laser in use is shown in <a href="#fig29">Figure 29</a>.</p>

the infrared region and cannot be
seen.</i></p>
</div>
<p>One of the least satisfactory aspects of the laser has
been its notoriously low efficiency. For a while the best
that could be accomplished was about 1%. That is, a hundred
watts of light had to be put in to get 1 watt of coherent
light out. In gas lasers the efficiency was even
lower, ranging from 0.01% to 0.1%.</p>
<p>In gas lasers this was no great problem since high power
was not the objective. But with the high-power solid lasers,
pumping power could be a major undertaking. A high-power
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
laser pump built by Westinghouse Research Laboratories
handles 70,000 joules. In more familiar terms,
the peak power input while the pump is on is about
100,000,000 watts. For a brief instant this is roughly equal
to all the electrical power needs of a city of 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Two relatively new developments have changed the efficiency
levels. One, the carbon dioxide gas laser, is quite
efficient, with the figure having passed 15%. The second is
the injection, or semiconductor laser, in which efficiencies
of more than 40% have been obtained. Unless unforeseen
difficulties arise this figure is expected to continue to rise
to a theoretical maximum of close to 100%.</p>

<p>The semiconductor laser is to solid and gas lasers what
the transistor was to the vacuum tube; all the functions of
the laser have been packed into a tiny semiconductor crystal.
In this case, electrons and &ldquo;holes&rdquo; (vacancies in the
crystal structure that act like positive charges) accomplish
the job done by excited atoms in the other types. That
is, when they are stimulated they fall from upper energy
states to lower ones, and emit coherent radiation in the
process. Aside from this the principle of operation is the
same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The device itself, however, is vastly different. For one
thing it is about the size of this letter &ldquo;o&rdquo; (<a href="#fig30">Figure 30</a>). For
another, it is self-contained; since it can convert electric
current directly into laser light&mdash;the first time this has
been possible&mdash;an external pumping source is not required.
This makes it possible to modulate the beam by
simply modulating the current. (A different approach has
been to modulate a magnetic field around the device. This,
it turns out, can also be done with some newer solid crystal
lasers.)</p>
<p>An additional advantage offered by the semiconductor
laser is simplicity. There are no gases or liquids to deal
with, no glassware to break, and no mirrors to align.
Although it will not deliver high power, it can already
deliver enough CW power for certain communications
purposes. Its simplicity, efficiency, and light weight make
it ideal for use in space.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">COMMUNICATIONS</span></h2>
<p>Future deep space missions are expected to require extremely
high data transmission rates (on the order of a
million bits<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> per second) to relay the huge quantities of
scientific and engineering information gathered by the
spacecraft. Higher data rates are necessary to increase
both the total capacity and the speed of transmission. By
comparison, the Mariner-4 spacecraft that sent back TV
pictures of Mars had a data rate of only eight bits per
second&mdash;a hundred thousand times too small for future
missions. The use of lasers would mean that results could
be transmitted to earth in seconds instead of the 8 hours it
took for the photos to be sent from Mariner-4.</p>
<p>One of the problems to be solved in using lasers for
deep space communication, oddly enough, is that of pointing
accuracy. Since the beam of laser energy is narrow, it
would be possible for the radiation to miss the earth altogether
and be lost entirely unless the laser were pointed
at the receiver with extreme precision. Aiming a gun at a
target 50 yards away is one thing; aiming a laser from an
unmanned spacecraft 100 million miles away is quite another.
It is believed, however, that present techniques can
cope with the problem.</p>
<p>Another peculiarity of laser communication is that it will
probably be accomplished faster and more readily in space
than here on earth. Powerful though laser light may be, it
is light and is therefore impeded to some extent by our
atmosphere even under good conditions. Data transmissions
of 20 and 30 miles have already been accomplished in good
weather with lasers.</p>
<p>But if you have ever tried to force a searchlight beam
or shine automobile headlights through heavy fog, rain, or
snow, you will appreciate the magnitude of the problem
under these conditions. The use of infrared frequencies
helps to some extent, since infrared is somewhat more
penetrating, but the poor-weather problem is a serious one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>A possible solution is the use of &ldquo;light pipes&rdquo;, similar
to the wave guides already in use for certain microwave
applications over short distances. But as often happens,
new developments create new needs; how, for example,
can we get the laser beam to stay centered in the pipe and
follow curves? A series of closely spaced lenses, about
1000 per mile, probably would accomplish this, but too
much light would be lost by scattering from the many lens
surfaces.</p>
<p>Scientists are experimenting with a new kind of &ldquo;lens&rdquo;,
one that uses variations in the density of gases to focus
and guide the beam automatically. Since there are no surfaces
in the path of the light beam, and since the gas is
transparent and free of turbulence, the laser beam is not
appreciably weakened or scattered as it travels through
the pipe.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/p23.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="516" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ss">Figure 31</span> <i>Laser light beam being guided
through a &ldquo;light pipe&rdquo; by
a gas &ldquo;lens&rdquo;. Heating coil (lower left) or mixture of gases (lower
right) are two possible ways of maintaining proper density gradient
in the gas.</i></p>
</div>
<p><a href="#fig31">Figure 31</a> shows how the gas focusing principle might
be used to guide a beam through a curving pipe. The shading
represents the density of the gas. Several means have
been developed to keep the gas denser in the center than
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
around the outside. When the pipe curves, the light beam
starts moving off the axis of the pipe. The gas then acts
like a prism, deflecting the light beam in the direction of
the curvature of the &ldquo;prism&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In communication between distant space and earth, a
light pipe might be a little cumbersome; hence it may prove
necessary to set up an intermediate orbiting relay station
that will, particularly in cases of poor weather, intercept
the incoming laser beam and convert it to radio frequencies
that can penetrate our atmosphere with greater reliability.</p>
<p>Powering space-borne lasers will, of course, be a problem.
Indeed one of the major unsolved problems in production
of spacecraft and long-term satellites is the provision
of an adequate supply of power. Fuel cells and solar cells
have helped but do not give the whole answer.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>One other approach has already been developed: a sun-pumped
laser. Sunlight focused onto the side of the laser
(see <a href="#fig32">Figure 32</a>) provides the pumping power, enabling the
device to put out 1 watt of continuous infrared radiation,
enough for special space applications. Descendents of this
device could produce visible light if this is deemed desirable.</p>
<p>Another approach, using <i>chemical lasers</i>, is even more
intriguing and may have greater consequences. Chemical
lasers will derive their energy from their internal chemistry
rather than from the outside. A mixture of two chemicals
may be all that is needed to initiate laser action
aboard a spacecraft or satellite. (Chemical lasers also
offer the promise of even greater concentrations of power
than have been achieved heretofore, which may make them
useful in plasma research.)</p>
<p>With all these possibilities, it may still be that spacecraft
will need more power than is available on board. The
narrow beam of the laser offers one more fascinating
possibility, especially in the case of satellites relatively
near earth. The light of a laser might actually be used to
beam energy to a receiver, either for immediate use or
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
storage. It would then become possible to &ldquo;refuel&rdquo; satellites
at will, giving them much greater capabilities.</p>
<p>If available laser power is great enough, laser beams
might even be used to push satellites back into their proper
orbits when they begin to wander off course, as they almost
invariably do after a while.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">A LASER IN YOUR FUTURE?</span></h2>
<p>Atomic energy, only a scientific
dream a few short years
ago, is now providing needed
power in many parts of the
world. In the same way, the
laser, also an atomic phenomenon,
has made its way
out of the laboratory and into
the fields of medicine, commerce,
and industry. If it
hasn&rsquo;t touched your life as
yet, you need only be patient.
It will.</p>
<p>Indeed the most exciting
probability of all is that lasers
undoubtedly will change our
lives in ways we cannot even
conceive of now.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
